# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## 1) Overview of Analysis
Throughout this project, we were helping Louise using Kickstarter campaign data to find identifiable similarities between successful and failed campaigns based on her interest. As the Kickstarter campaign data came in raw form, we used excel features such as conditional formatting, pivot tables, and charts to organize the data in a fashion that would identify these similarities. 
## 2) Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
Louise is interested in Theater, so we used outcome results to help determine if there is a better time of year or realistic goal amount that she should consider when launching her Kickstarter campaign to increase her chance of success. Using Pivot Tables, VLookups, Data Charts, and Count formulas, we developed two charts that could visualize the data in a way to identify if her desired variables exist.
