# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## 1) Overview of Analysis
Throughout this project, we were helping Louise using Kickstarter campaign data to find identifiable similarities between successful and failed campaigns based on her interest. As the Kickstarter campaign data came in raw form, we used excel features such as conditional formatting, pivot tables, and charts to organize the data in a fashion that would identify these similarities. 
## 2) Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis
Louise is interested in Theater, so we used outcome results to help determine if there is a better time of year or realistic goal amount that she should consider when launching her Kickstarter campaign to increase her chance of success. Using Pivot Tables, VLookups, Data Charts, and Count formulas, we developed two charts that could visualize the data in a way to identify if her desired variables exist.

### Challenges
My entire career, I have been using excel, so most of these exercises were easy.  However, because I was lazy in Deliverable 2, I didn't want to type out all the changes in the CountIfs formulas. Therefore, I created Greater Than and Less Than Columns so that I could copy the formulas down. While this worked and saved me time when I created the chart, I wasn't able to filter out these columns, so while my chart data was correct, the X-Axis labels were screwed up. To fix this, I copied and pasted it in another section of the workbook as a number. Then I deleted my Greater Than and Less Than Columns. After this, I recreated the chart, and I did not have any problems.
