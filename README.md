# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## 1) Overview of Analysis
Throughout this project, we were helping Louise using Kickstarter campaign data to find identifiable similarities between successful and failed campaigns based on her interest. As the Kickstarter campaign data came in raw form, we used excel features such as conditional formatting, pivot tables, and charts to organize the data in a fashion that would identify these similarities.
